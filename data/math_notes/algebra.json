        "Identify the equation type to select the appropriate solving method.",
        "For linear equations, simplify both sides then isolate the variable.",
        "For quadratic equations, check the discriminant to determine solution types, try factoring first; if that fails, apply the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)) / (2a).",
        "Always substitute your solution back into the original equation to verify its correctness.",
        "For equations with multiple variables, consider substitution or elimination methods, and check for any possible restrictions on the variables.",
        "When faced with complex expressions, break the problem into smaller steps to avoid errors.",
        "For inequalities, remember to reverse the inequality sign when multiplying or dividing by a negative number.",
        "Look for common factors that can be canceled or factored out to simplify the equation.",
        "Use step-by-step algebraic manipulation to ensure that no details are lost, which is essential for automated reasoning.",
        "In cases involving irrational numbers or radicals, simplify radicals where possible to reduce complexity."
